# Power-Query
Learn Power Query through practical examples—covering data cleaning, transformations, joins etc.


Power Query is a Microsoft ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool used to connect, combine, and refine data sources for analysis. Embedded in Excel and Power BI, it allows users to import data from various locations, clean and shape it without changing the original source, and automate repetitive data preparation tasks. It uses a visual interface and the M language to create repeatable steps.
